# email-scraping
Importing the IMAPlib library for accessing the gmail account from which we want to scrape the data. Here I am using my account and a temporary password for accessing the data.
Then we are defining a function in which the message body will be displayed and then we are defining a search function. Making a function to search emails amoung different emails.
Later on we will make a connection to connect the link and then accessing the account by user account and password. The last step is we print the messages filtering the messages having "Thank you for applying".
